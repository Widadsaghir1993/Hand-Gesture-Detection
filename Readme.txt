EARTH MOVER'S DISTANCE
----------------------------------------


VERSION/INFO
------------

This implementation is based on "The Earth Mover's Distance
as a Metric for Image Retrieval", Y. Rubner, C. Tomasi and L. Guibas,
International Journal of Computer Vision, 40(2), pp. 99-121, 2000.


USAGE
-----

emd ---> computes the earth mover's distance between two signatures
gmd ---> computes the ground distance matrix between two signatures
gdf ---> computes the ground distance between two feature vectors
test --> is an auxiliary module to show how the above functions work
